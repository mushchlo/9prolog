    Purpose: define the tty* predicates for Dec-10 compatability
		NB: display does NOT switch to the terminal!

    A particularly nasty thing to watch out for here is that we
    can't afford to fail between the time we switch to 'user' and
    the time we switch back.  Hence the 'is's.  I had put these
    predicates in Prolog before Fernando put them into his C version.
    I have left them in Prolog because they are almost never used.
    Any time they are used, the dominant cost is likely to be I/O.

    ttyflush used to be here.  It is now in C so that people can send
    control sequences to /dev/tty without fear of line folding, but
    can then force the buffered output out.  As a hack, ttyflush(X)
    is equivalent to fflush(X) in C for any output file X.

ttytab(Spaces) :-
	N is Spaces, telling(Old, user), tab(N), tell(Old).

ttyput(Char) :-
	C is Char, telling(Old, user), put(C), tell(Old).

ttynl :-
	telling(Old, user), nl, tell(Old).

ttyget0(Char) :-
	seeing(Old, user), get0(C), see(Old), Char = C.

ttyget(Char) :-
	seeing(Old, user), get(C), see(Old), Char = C.

ttyskip(Char) :-
	C is Char, seeing(Old, user), skip(C), see(Old).
