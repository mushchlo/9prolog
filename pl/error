    Purpose: display error messages at the terminal.

	This is just the beginning of a better  error  handling  system.
    $error(Message,  Culprit)  writes  an  error  Message  on the "user"
    stream, and prints the Culprit.  On UNIX, we really should  have  an
    "error"  stream  that these messages can be sent to, and the tracing
    messages should also go there.  In practice, "user" will serve.

	Some errors should cause aborts, some failures, and  some  ought
    to  switch  debugging  on.  This needs thinking about.  The culprits
    used to be 'print'ed, they are now 'write'n.   I really have not the
    least idea which is better.
